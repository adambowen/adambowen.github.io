Adam Bowen is a software developer who started commercial software development
in 2007. He has worked on a wide variety of products, including two high
accuracy fingerprint matching algorithms, biometric access control (both as
an SDK and a first party product), workforce management, [construction site
management](www.biosite.com) (including "cloud" based products), electronic
image management for police forces, tools for visualising medical DICOM images,
and a [highly scalable HPC debugger and profiler](www.allinea.com). He has a cat
called Toffee.

He is interested in what it takes to make software development work in
commercial environments, everything from deciding what features are important,
through specification, testing and delivery. He's an advocate of agile
development, and any software practice that emphasises iteration as the basis
of quality. He's most familiar with C++, JavaScript and Python - but doesn't
think the tools define the programmer.

This blog is a place to collect his thoughts and philosophies on software
development, if you've worked with him in the past, work with him now, or think
you might want to in the future you might find it worth a read. If not, you
might still find it worth a read - but there is a wealth of other information
out there too!
