<a href="https://github.com/consort-cmake/consort-cmake">Consort CMake</a> is a
set of opinionated functions and macros for
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> designed to make managing large
projects easier.


<h2><i class="fa fa-code fa-2x"></i> Declarative</h2>
<p>
	The Consort syntax for creating targets is designed to look
	"declarative", making it easier to read and remember how to
	add new targets. Stop worrying about your build environment and
	start focusing on your code!

<h2><i class="fa fa-tachometer fa-2x"></i> YASM</h2>
<p>
	Out-of-the-box support for YASM assembly makes it as painless as
	possible to add ASM optimisations to your code that will behave
	the same way regardless of the targeted compiler. Consort adds
	plenty of convenience macros as well, so when your assembler
	needs to know about the target platform you can easily use the
	YASM preprocessor to switch on the appropriate instructions to
	handle platform specific calling conventions.
</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-desktop fa-2x"></i> Qt</h2>
<p>
	Out-of-the-box support for Qt makes it easy to incorporate Qt
	into your build. Consort can find Qt for you, and perform much
	of the configuration necessary to build Qt UI files, resources
	and translations into your code.
</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-rocket fa-2x"></i> Boost</h2>
<p>
	Out-of-the-box support for Boost means you can easily make use
	of the boost libraries in your code. Consort will sanitise the
	boost libraries as much as possible to make sure you have an
	easy to use and consistent cross platform build.
</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-gears fa-2x"></i> Modules</h2>
<p>
	Consort's built in module system makes it easy to share code,
	without slowing down your build by introducing targets that
	don't need to be built. Consort will automatically detect when
	you link to a module, and include the CMake code necessary to
	build that target. Plus, no more merge conflicts on the top
	level CMakeLists.txt as it won't need updating as often.
</p>

<h2>And more...</h2>
<p>
	Consort includes numerous other options and default
	configuration to help you get your project up and running faster,
	including automatically setting suitable warning levels, adding
	consistently named #defines for architecture and platform, and
	tools to copy required resources to your build directory.
