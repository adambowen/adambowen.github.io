Continuing the theme of real retrospective examples, this post is another
example of a real retrospective. These posts lag somewhat behind my team's
actual work, so please forgive me if I appear to have failed to learn any
lessons highlighted in the last post!

### Setting the stage

I opened this retrospective by listing the stories we completed (and those we
didn't), showed the burndown, and our velocity over the last few sprints. I also
summarised the actions we'd decided on in the last few retrospectives.

As with the previous retrospective I was trying to refresh the team's memory
about the last sprint, and trying to set an implicit focus on the team's
velocity (the recent trend had been in the wrong direction, and I wanted to see
if there was anything underlying that).

As before, I found that the opening was not very engaging - and therefore I
suspect that it didn't serve to refresh the team's memory as well as it could
have done.

I again used [plans-for-retrospectives.com](https://plans-for-retrospectives.com/)
to generate some activities, then tweaked them so that I could get a clean
flow throughout the retrospective. This time I used an activity called "Last
Retro's Actions Table" to set the stage. I'd noticed a tendency to creation
actions without following through, and I wanted to help focus the retrospective
back on what we'd previously decided.

I wrote down our previous commitments, and added columns labelled 'More of',
'Keep doing', 'Less of' and 'Stop doing'. I got everyone to vote on which
column they felt each action belonged in. For almost all the actions the
consensus was wither "keep doing" or "more of", so I went through the list and
tried to get the team to suggest ways we could follow through on the actions
we weren't doing. When we felt that an action had become "part of our day-to-day"
we removed it from the board.

Overall this was a pretty useful activity, and I can easily imagine building a
retrospective where this was part of the "gather data" phase.

### Gather data

For gathering data I used "Analyze Stories". Writing this up several weeks after
we did the retrospective I remember nothing about this activity...which probably
means it wasn't very useful. In essence, I went through each story and asked
the team how they felt it went and how it could have gone better. This is a bit
like the "three questions" I have discussed in the past, but helps to focus the
team on the actual work.

### Generate insights

I used an activity called "the worst we could do" to generate insights. The idea
of this activity is to ask the team for ways we could make the next sprint a
certain disaster. I picked it because it sounded fun, which may not be the best
reason - but helps to liven up the retrospective at a time when it might be
starting to lose energy.

Having gathered the team's answers, I then flipped all the ideas around and
looked to see what we were doing to _prevent_ them from happening.

So...this activity...firstly, you need to think very carefully how you set this
up - I just threw it out there and waited, but the team was (understandably)
confused about what I was looking for. After all, "we just don't come in to
work" pretty much guarantees the sprint will fail, but doesn't really help us
find ways to improve. If I use this activity again I will have to think more
carefully about how I focus the activity and the boundaries I set on answers.

On the plus side, once I started to get answers they were fairly easy to flip
around and look at what we're doing to prevent them (for example, "delete
every other line of Javascript" was a suggestion, which is easily prevented
with our code review and automated regression testing).

![delete every other line of Javascript]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/disaster.png "This is why I like compiled languages.")


### Decide what to do

Err...yeah...looking back at my notes I somehow didn't really do this. I was
trying to keep the retrospective on time, and some of the earlier activities
did generate actions (in particular the very early focus on our _outstanding_
actions).

### Close the retrospective

I closed the retrospective with the same activity again - asking everyone for

- One thing that pleased or surprised them this retrospective
- One person they would like to acknowledge for something they did this
  iteration.

This was less helpful than the previous retrospective, but I still got the very
interesting feedback that looking over our previous actions was a useful
activity.
